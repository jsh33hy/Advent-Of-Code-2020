# Advent of Code 2020

Using this challenge as an opportunity to improve my idiomatic Kotlin skills for the sanity of the [yum.dev](https://yum.dev) Android team.

#### Instructions
Everything runs from the command line. To see the solution for a problem:

1. Clone Repo
```sh
git clone --depth=1 https://https://github.com/jsh33hy/Advent-Of-Code-2020 <project_name>
cd <project_name>
```
2. Run the solver for a specific day/problem combination
```
./solve.sh [day#] [problem#]
```
Example:
```
./solve.sh 2 1 ## solves day2 problem
```
